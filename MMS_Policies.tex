\newrule{Blaster Design Factory Rules}{July 9, 2023}

\subsection{Background and Purpose}

The Mines Maker Society is committed to developing a strong “making community” at Colorado School of Mines. The Maker Society will enable these individuals to make anything that they wish to create in the easiest conceivable way for the person wishing to learn (while complying with Mines’ regulations and all applicable laws). 

This policy outlines rules that govern the Blaster Design Factory and Mines Maker Society.

\subsection{Policy}

In addition to abiding by the Mines Student Code of Conduct, members of the Mines Maker Society and the Makerspace community will adhere to the following guidelines or risk banishment.  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No cursing louder than normal speaking volume and never directly at another person.  
    \item No selling of goods or services under any circumstances in the space.  
    \item No using machinery/tools/anything in the space to make items for profit.  
    \item No storing of items in the space unless approved and only in the marked grey bins for the approved time period.  
    \item Clean up after yourself and the people you let into the space (or make sure they clean up for themselves). This includes wiping the whiteboards after one is done writing. Leave it better than you found it. 
    \item No playing music loud enough so the offices above the makerspace can hear it between the hours of 7am and 6pm. Absolutely no music with obscene lyrics/messages during this time. Between the hours of 6pm and 7am the next morning (after hours), use best judgement, but stay away from playing music that would be offensive to at least 30\% of the population. If you wonder if it is allowed, err on the side of caution and do not play it. Noise is not an issue during these times unless someone asks you to turn it down. Comply at this point.  
    \item No writing offensive messages. We are a diverse community. Be respectful. 
    \item No destroying/stealing Maker Society property.  
    \item The Maker Society Executive and Leadership Team reserve the right to hold Executive Session in the Blaster Design Factory when necessary, though this should be done outside of open hours when possible. 
    \item Do not leave your items on tables or workplaces, unattended for longer than 20 minutes.
\end{enumerate}

This list of rules is not comprehensive. Please always use best judgement in actions and words.

\subsection{Sanctions}

Pursuant to the Bylaws of the Mines Maker Society, SAIL and BSO Guidelines, and the Mines Student Code of Conduct, the Executive Board, in consultation with the Club Advisor and the Leadership Board, may sanction individuals for violating the rules of the Mines Maker Society and Blaster Design Factory. Before an individual is sanctioned, a meeting should be scheduled with them to provide Due Process. 

Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, required safety training, loss of privileges within the Blaster Design Factory, ineligibility to hold Office within the Mines Maker Society, and in exceptional circumstances, loss of access to the Blaster Design Factory.  

\subsection{Review}

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by Maker Society Leadership. 






\newrule{3D Printing Rules}{February 27, 2023}

\subsection{Background and Purpose}

The Mines Maker Society is committed to developing a strong “making community” at Colorado School of Mines. The Maker Society will enable these individuals to make anything that they wish to create in the easiest conceivable way for the person wishing to learn (while complying with Mines’ regulations and all applicable laws). 

This policy outlines rules for Maker Society Members and Members of the Mines Community to use the 3D printing resources of the Mines Maker Society. 

\bremove{\subsection{Policy}}

\badd{\subsection{General Rules}}

The following is a list of laws that anyone must abide by to 3D print in Blaster Design Factory. Failure to comply may result in the suspension of 3D Printing rights. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Before slicing your first print talk to a space captain on duty, even if you have 3D printing experience. 
    \item Fill out the print survey and the Maker Info placard for all prints. 
    \item Monitor the first layer of the print to make sure it adheres to the build plate. 
    \bremove{\item Don’t put glue on the 3D printer without Space Captain approval. 
    Prints longer than 12 hours or over 250 grams require Space Captain approval. This limit may be changed by the Maker Society Leadership Board during high-volume times of the year.
    \item Only Space Captains are allowed to change filament on the printer.}

    \badd{\item When all printers are in use, printers will operate on a first-come, first-served basis. People wishing to print must put their Blastercards in the Print Queue to get in line for printing. People in the print queue may not leave the BDF for prolonged periods of time and remain in the Print Queue. The Space Captain on duty, Executive/Leadership Board Members, and Space-trusted Directors/Individuals will oversee the use of the Print Queue. Shall a printer become available and the next individual in the print queue not be present, then the open printer shall go to the next present person in the Print Queue.}
    
    \item Do not attempt to repair 3D printers, including performing maintenance and/or calibration. Printer Technicians and Maker Society Leadership may designate other trained persons who may maintain printers or perform repairs.
    
    \bremove{\item Use of personal filament requires Space Captain approval.}
    \item One person should not use more than one printer at a time. 
    \bremove{\item Only trained Space Captains and Makerspace Leadership are allowed to run and process resin prints.}
    \item Guns, parts for guns, or gun-like parts, porn, and sexual content are not allowed to be printed in the makerspace under any circumstances. If we suspect that your print may break this rule, we will cancel the print and destroy the part.  
    \item Profane language may only be printed with Space Captain approval and outside of working hours. 
    \bremove{\item Only PLA and PETG materials with no additives are to be printed in the Blaster Design Factory. Exceptions can be made by the Executive Board.}
    \item The 3D Printing Guidelines may be adjusted accordingly by the Maker Society Executive Board to accommodate times of the semester with increased traffic. 
\end{enumerate}

\badd{
\subsection{Filament Printing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Don’t put glue on the 3D printer without Space Captain approval. 
    Prints longer than 12 hours or over 250 grams require Space Captain approval. This limit may be changed by the Maker Society Leadership Board during high-volume times of the year.
    \item Only Space Captains and trained individuals are allowed to change filament on the printer. 
    \item Use of personal filament requires Space Captain approval.
    \item Only PLA and PETG materials with no additives are to be printed in the Blaster Design Factory. Exceptions can be made by the Executive Board and Technicians. % Note: add technicians to approval process
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resin Printing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only trained Space Captains and Makerspace Leadership are allowed to run and process resin prints.
    \item Any person running resin prints must have completed the EHS Lab Safety and Hazardous Waste Generator Trainings before they are allowed to use the resin printers.
    \item Refer to the SOPs for the Elegoo Mars 3 and Prusa SL1S Speed when printing. Having access to the SOP without a training from a person approved to SLA print does not constitute proper training to use the resin printers.
    \item The Executive Board, Leadership Board, and/or Technicians shall maintain a list of people approved to use the resin printers.
\end{itemize}

}

\subsection{Sanctions}

Individuals and groups who violate 3D printing rules may be sanctioned by the Executive Board in accordance with the procedures established in Mines Maker Society Rules. The most appropriate sanction for violating 3D printing rules is recommended to be a warning, followed by a loss of 3D printing privileges for additional violations. In addition, for violation of Section 2.11, a meeting will be scheduled with the offending individuals or groups to discuss sanctions and/or other repercussions. 

\subsection{Review}

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by Maker Society Leadership.

\subsection{Review}

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by Maker Society Leadership.




\newrule{Space Cleanliness}{September 13, 2024}

\subsection{Background and Purpose}
The Mines Maker Society is committed to developing a strong “making community” at Colorado School of Mines. The Maker Society will enable these individuals to make anything that they wish to create in the easiest conceivable way for the person wishing to learn (while complying with Mines’ regulations and all applicable laws).

An important part of a strong making community is ensuring that clean and space safe to work in.

\subsection{Policy}

In order to maintain a clean and safe space, please follow these guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, your work area should be cleaned to the state you found it in or better. 
    \item If you write on the whiteboard tables or the glass, wipe it away before you leave your work area.
    \item If you take tools or materials out of any of the chests, cabinets, materials cart, or the cage, return what was removed back to it’s original location once you finish your work for the day.
    \item If you use a machine in the Blaster Design Factory, turn off the machine once you have finished using it (3D printers only need to be turned off over breaks unless in use).
    \item If you are going to be leaving your work area for greater than twenty (20) minutes, clean up the spot that you were working on to make it look like you haven’t worked there. 
    \item If you’re using cutting tools that leave particles on the floor, it is your responsibility to vacuum the floor and the surrounding areas using the shop-vac.
    \item If using the vinyl cutter, you must remember to remove any images copied to or downloaded to the vinyl cutter computer before logging off. Additionally, all vinyl/transfer paper scraps must be thrown away when done.
    \item Food may not be stored, prepared, or consumed in the Blaster Design Factory, except in the case of an event approved by a majority of the Leadership and Executive Boards and when no active work is being completed by any person in the BDF.
    \item Unplug hot glue guns when not in use.
    \item Turn off the soldering iron when not in use.
\end{itemize}

Due to the characteristics of epoxy and fiber-reinforced composites, additional guidelines have been put in place to ensure effective and safe use of these materials:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All epoxy storage, work, and curing must stay within the designated epoxy area. The epoxy area is marked with blue floor marking tape. Epoxy may only leave the designated area during workshops approved by a majority of the Executive and Leadership Boards.
    \item All curing epoxy and components with curing epoxy must remain in the designated epoxy curing area until the epoxy has fully hardened. The epoxy curing area is marked with green floor marking tape.
    \item Epoxy components (resin, hardener, and additives) must remain in the epoxy cabinet when not in use.
    \item Epoxy may not be used at the fabrics station, computer table, or soldering station.
    \item Before working with epoxy, your working surface(s) must be protected with wax paper or cardboard. Paper and other absorbant materials may not be used to protect surfaces.
    \item After working with epoxy, all working surface(s) must be throughly cleaned. Epoxy may not remain on whiteboard tables or work tables in any form.
    \item The epoxy curing area should be kept clear when not actively being used. Fully cured epoxy and epoxied components should be removed from the epoxy curing area to make space for other active projects. 
    \item All work with loose fiber reinforcement (including cloth, fabric, and tow), including cutting and layups, must be done over the concrete floor. After work, all loose fibers must be cleaned with the broom and shop-vac. 
    \item Fiber-reinforced composites (including those reinforced with basalt fiber, carbon fiber, or glass fiber) may not be cut, sanded, machined, or otherwise generate dust in the Blaster Design Factory except when the following conditions are met:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Work with these composites is done after hours
        \item Work is done with proper dust extraction to minimize airborne particles
        \item All individuals working with these composites are wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
        \item All individuals in the Blaster Design Factory are notified of the work with these composites
        \item All dust is thoroughly cleaned after working to minimize exposure to other individuals using the Blaster Design Factory
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Any composite fibers or dust left in the Blaster Design Factory will result in a one (1) week suspension of all work on composites in the Blaster Design Factory.
\end{itemize}

This is not an exhaustive list. The members of the Maker Society Executive and Leadership Boards may request that individuals and groups abide by reasonable expectations.

\subsection{Conflict of Interest}
This Policy outlines procedures by which organizations other than the Mines Maker Society may request exceptions to the rules. Should an external organization request an exception to the rules, any Officer of the external organization who is also an Officer of the Mines Maker Society shall abstain from voting on approving the exception. This shall only apply to procedures outlined in this policy.

\subsection{Sanctions}

The first significant violation of space cleanliness will result in a warning from a member of the Leadership Board. Further significant violations will each result in a one (1) week suspension from using all tools and materials relevant to the violation. Repeated violations of these guidelines may also result in a meeting with member(s) of the Executive and/or Leadership Boards, and further sanctions may be applied. These sanctions may apply to individuals or organizations who use the Blaster Design Factory.

\subsection{Review}

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by Maker Society Leadership.
